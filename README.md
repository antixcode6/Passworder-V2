<h2>Passworder-V2</h2>
A while ago I wrote a script utility to generate passwords. That script was cumbersom, slow, overcomplicated, and had no instructions on how to use it. </br>
Now I've decided to re-visit the password generation topic for a work project and I have written a V2 of my old script.

This one is 
<ol>
<li>Simplier<p>It generates the passwords right from your device regardless of internet connection</p></li>
<li>Easier<p>It is a simple command line tool built using the <a href ="http://click.pocoo.org/6/why/"> Click Python package</a>
 As well once the deployment package is prepared the setup will be much easier since there is one dependency</li>
<li>Faster <p>This program functions faster as the feed back is instant</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Things to come</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make the deployment package</li>
  <li>Test on Linux, and if necessary make changes</li>
  <li>Find and work on any bugs</li>
  <li>Add support for phonetic alphabet while using special characters</li>
  <li>More features if I can think of any</li>
</ul>
